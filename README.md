### Description

This is a simple list of German medical terms formatted as a UTF8-encoded text file. It is based on the medicalterms project by Tobias Quathamer and was designed to work with Android dictionary managers.


### Usage

##### **Android**

Copy `wordlist.txt` to the root directory of your Android phone. Then install the excellent [User Dictionary Manager](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.usr.dict.mgr) by Adrian Vintu and use it to import the terms to your user dictionary. More information may be found [here](http://udm.adrianvintu.com/). 
> **Note**: Because of the size of the wordlist importing might take a while.

#### **LibreOffice**

##### *Automatic installation*

If you are using Linux your distribution might be shipping with a ready-made package of this dictionary (e.g. `hunspell-med-de` on Ubuntu). Unfortunately add-on dictionaries don't appear to work properly in recent version of LibreOffice (1). I advise to try the package in your distribution's repository out before deciding to manually install my wordlist. 

##### *Manual installation*

Follow the instructions provided in [this Q&A](http://ask.libreoffice.org/en/question/11170/create-basic-english-dictionary/?answer=11187#post-id-11187) to create a new custom dictionary. Make sure to name it in a recongizable fashion (e.g. medicalterms.de) and activate it in the menu. 

[Find out where your LO user profile is located](https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/UserProfile#User_profile_location). Then proceed to navigate to `<LO user profile directory>\3\user\wordbook` and find your dictionary (e.g. medicalterms-de.dic). Open it in a text editor of your choice (e.g. Gedit on Ubuntu; Notepad++ on Windows, NOT Notepad!). Copy and paste the full contents of `wordlist.txt` below the dashed line (`---`). Save the file while making sure it remains UTF-8 encoded and restart LibreOffice.

#### **Word**

Rename `wordlist.txt` to `medicalterms-de.dic` and follow the instructions provided [here](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322198).
